# Process as a System II: An Organic Development Lifecycle Model for Systems Engineering

## Introduction

### Organic development
1. Development is done by humans
2. Needs to be executable organically by humans
3. Some issues with system development are caused by inorganic processes
   1. Against human thought process
      1. Requirements, Architecture, Implementation
   2. Against physical existence
      1. Documents and specification

Systems development (for the time being) is conducted by human beings with the support of technology through tools, software, and electronics. While a lot of focus is set on the technology aspect of systems engineering, little attention is given to the human aspects regarding the understanding and performance of systems engineering processes.

### Illusion of explanatory depth
   1. The sense that one understands complex issues more deeply than one does.
      1. Quickly rate knowledge of various issues x/10 (t1 rating)
      2. Ask to deeply one issue
      3. Re-rate the knowledge of issue (t3 rating)

We seldomly are asked to really explain a concept.

*See: intellectual humility*

### Hill climbing

Incremental improvement finds local maxima

Finding the global maximum requires non-incremental improvement

## Scope of this Document

Relationship instead of interaction, interface, dependency

### First principles thinking

1. Establish purpose
2. Understand elements and their function
3. Challenge pre-existing concepts
4. Re-align the model towards the purpose

### Structure leads behavior

### Real world development
1. Development concepts should suit to real world practice
2. Existing development concepts 
   1. V-Model creates unnecessary abstraction at the architecture/integration levelx
   2. Agility is perceived as a counter to v-model, which it is not
   3. PDCA is too high level
3. Building an energy efficient house
   1. Some of the work can only be done in a series
   2. Some of the work can be parallel

### No difference between system/software/hardware/mechanic

### No difference between unit/component

### Design is not documentation

### Hierarchy model for development artifacts

### Algorithm for development activities

## An organic flow of development activities

### The purpose of a development lifecycle
1. The development lifecycle model shall guide the required activities and artifacts, to ensure the development achieves its purpose.
2. The development purpose, shall include customer satisfaction, to ensure that customer needs are met.

### Systems Thinking

Systems thinking is an approach to abstract a system and its parts into a model as elements and relationships between elements. As the system contains parts and those parts contain other parts, so does the model and its elements. Every part of the system is directly represented by an element and its relationships. An element demarcates the boundaries of a part, while the relationships connect it to other parts.

```mermaid
   flowchart LR
      subgraph Design["Design Model"]
         subgraph Model["System Model"]
            Elements
            Relationships
         end
         Requirements
      end

      subgraph System
         Parts["Parts"]
      end

      subgraph Mission
         Needs
      end

      Parts--"integrate"-->Parts

       Elements~~~Requirements
      Relationships~~~Requirements


      Requirements~~~Parts

      Needs--"analyze"-->Elements
      Elements--"configure"-->Relationships
      Elements--"configure"-->Elements

      Elements<-."represents".->Parts
```


Using this abstraction one can understand the complexity of the system.

Another way of looking at this abstraction is to understand its complexity


Structure yields behavior -> It is important to structure the model organically to ensure that development takes place organically.

### Systems Design

The word "design" has its origins in the Latin word "designare," which originally meant "to mark out," "to choose," or "to appoint." In the context of systems engineering design activities can be seen as a series of choices based on the analysis of preconditions or alternatives for the system. The design documents choices regarding the makeup of the system by assigning requirements to specific elements or relationships. These choices support the development of the system for low complexity through, decoupling, separation, and simplification. The depth of the model shall support the effective allocation of the requirements, meaning that the chosen element or relationship can actually implement the requirement.

```mermaid
   flowchart LR
      subgraph Design
         subgraph Model
            Elements
            Relationships
         end
         Requirements
      end

      subgraph System
         Parts["Parts"]
      end

      subgraph Mission
         Needs
      end

      Parts--"integrate"-->Parts

      Elements--"allocate"-->Requirements
      Relationships--"allocate"-->Requirements
      Requirements--"implement"-->Parts

      Needs--"analyze"-->Elements
      Elements--"configure"-->Relationships
      Elements--"configure"-->Elements

      Elements<-."represents".->Parts
      Design<-."represents".->System
```

In traditional systems engineering processes, requirements engineering is seen as a precursor to design activities, despite the fact that a requirement can not be formulated without referencing elements from within the design. In this development lifecycle the design definition can not be separated, a requirement is dependent on the definition of its element and an element is characterized by its requirement.

Concepts, Diagrams are requirements

### V-model

The v-model introduces the aspect of verifying the system based on the defined design and validating based on the defined needs. This ensures two crucial objectives within system engineering, building the right system (validation), the right way (verification).

*TODO: Add image v-model*

One of the common issues with the v-model is the question of: what is the appropriate level of detail for testing? The model establishes abstraction layers between unit tests, integration tests, qualification tests, acceptance tests, and so on. These artificial separations are based on the separation of units, components, architectural design and detailed design. Yet, there is no common definition of what each of those artifacts are, or how to identify them. They are largely based on individual organizational needs and add little benefit to the development process itself. Even worse, when used to structure organizations they cause unproductive process separations that are here to stay.

With the use of an organic design model verification strategies can be appropriately applied, as the focus of the verification can be determined by an element's position and surroundings in the model. An implemented part can be tested according to the requirements that are directly specified for its element in the model. Once integrated, the elementโs relationships and their requirements determine the integration tests. After all relevant parts are integrated and the system is to be base lined, all verification tests can be executed. This approach offers a nuanced and automate-able approach to verification testing without the need for an artificial hierarchy of units, parts, and components.

    - **Test cases**
      - verifies the achievement of a requirement
      - **Verify Parts**
        - After implementation of a part, verify all requirements of its respective element via their respective test cases.
        - After integration of a part, verify all requirements of its respective element's relationships via their respective test cases.
      - **Verify System**
        - After integration of all relevant parts into the system, verify all requirements via their respective test cases.
  - **Need**: The development process implements a system that satisfies the needs.
